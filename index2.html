            — 
            Nigeria’s opposition candidates for president say they will challenge the results declaring the ruling party candidate the winner. Saturday’s election was marred by technical and staff problems that saw voting delayed by a day or more at some polling stations.
            
            The Labour Party met with journalists and supporters Wednesday afternoon, hours after the electoral commission declared Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the candidate for the ruling All Progressives Congress party, as the winner of Saturday’s election.
            
            Labour's presidential candidate Peter Obi did not attend Wednesday's meeting but his deputy told reporters he and Obi will challenge presidential results in court.
